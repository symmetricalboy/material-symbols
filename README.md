This is a repackaging/reorganization of Google's *Material Symbols* icons, which are published at [Google/material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons). Specifically, these are the .svg files found within [this folder](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/symbols/web).

The icons there are organized in a folder structure of 3,150 folders grouping all 504 variations of each individual glyph. Here, instead, I have grouped all 3,150 unique glyphs into 504 folders by variant. This allows you to grab a full set of icons in a chosen style variant much more easily.

This was done primarily for usage with [Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize), a plugin for [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases), but the full library was sorted so that it may serve some use in other applications in the future.

If you would like to explore the available glyphs in *Material Symbols*, check out [this page on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
